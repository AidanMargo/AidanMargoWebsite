1. Explain "Background Positioning" and why in the navlinks li:hover it isn't background-color instead of color
2. Why does the photo need to be display: flex in order to prevent a gap between it and the navlinks
3. How can I clean up this code a bit?
4. Why do the dino and rock images start at different positions, and thus need different margins
     to be positioned on the same level?
